# Drag and Drop with Websocket

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate drag and drop of a file and subsequent upload 
to a Go server over websockets. Files are added to the `out/` folder but ignored from the git
project.

Comments in the JavaScript are detailed and explain how the code works. There are no external 
frontend dependencies. The Go server uses only Gobwas and the standard library.
